# 🖥️ Basic Linux Commands (and What Happens in the Background)

Linux is a command-line–driven operating system at its core. These basic commands are the **foundation for interacting with the file system**. They let us explore directories, manipulate files, and control data flow.

When you type a command in the shell (like Bash, Zsh, etc.), here’s what generally happens in the background:

1. The shell parses your input.  
2. It looks for the binary (like `/bin/ls`, `/bin/cp`) in directories listed in the `$PATH` variable.  
3. Once found, the shell starts a process to execute it.  
4. The command interacts with the **kernel system calls** (like `open()`, `read()`, `write()`, `unlink()`) to perform the action.  
5. The output (if any) is written to **stdout** (your terminal), unless redirected.  

Now let’s break down each command.

## 📂 1. `ls` – List Directory Contents

**Why we use it:**
- To see files and directories inside the current or specified path.  
- Often used with options like `ls -l` (detailed view), `ls -a` (show hidden files).  

**Background working:**
- `ls` calls the `opendir()` and `readdir()` system calls to fetch directory entries.  
- It then formats and prints the results on your terminal.  
- When options are given (`-l`), it fetches metadata using the `stat()` system call (file size, permissions, timestamps).

## 🚶 2. `cd` – Change Directory

**Why we use it:**
- To move from one directory to another.  
- Essential for navigating the filesystem hierarchy.  

**Background working:**
- Unlike other commands, `cd` is a **shell built-in** (not a separate binary).  
- It uses the `chdir()` system call to switch the current working directory of the shell process.  
- The shell updates the environment variable `$PWD` to reflect the new directory.

## 📋 3. `cp` – Copy Files and Directories

**Why we use it:**
- To make duplicates of files or folders without altering the original.  
- Useful for backup, testing, or replicating files.  

**Background working:**
- `cp` opens the source file using `open()` and reads data using `read()`.  
- It creates a new destination file with `open()` + `O_CREAT` flag and writes data with `write()`.  
- For directories, it recursively copies contents if the `-r` option is given.  

---

## 🔄 4. `mv` – Move or Rename Files

**Why we use it:**
- To move a file/directory from one place to another.  
- To rename files (moving within the same directory but with a new name).  

**Background working:**
- If source and destination are on the same filesystem, `mv` uses the `rename()` system call → just updates metadata (super fast).  
- If across different filesystems, it performs `cp` + `rm`: copy the file, then delete the original.  

---

## ❌ 5. `rm` – Remove Files

**Why we use it:**
- To delete files and directories permanently.  
- With `-r`, it removes directories recursively.  

**Background working:**
- `rm` does **not erase file data immediately**.  
- It calls the `unlink()` system call, which removes the directory entry pointing to the file.  
- The file’s data blocks remain on disk until no process is using it, after which the kernel marks them as free space.  

---

## 📖 6. `cat` – Concatenate and Display Files

**Why we use it:**
- To quickly view the contents of a file.  
- To combine multiple files into one.  
- Often used in pipelines (e.g., `cat file | grep keyword`).  

**Background working:**
- `cat` opens the file with `open()`, reads with `read()`, and writes directly to stdout with `write()`.  
- It doesn’t format content; it just streams raw bytes.  

---

## 📜 7. `more` – View File Page by Page

**Why we use it:**
- To read large files in a scrollable manner (line by line or page by page).  
- Useful when the file is too big for `cat`.  

**Background working:**
- `more` internally uses `cat`-like reading but buffers the output.  
- It waits for user input (space → next page, enter → next line).  
- Once you quit, it stops reading the file.  

---

## 📜 8. `less` – Advanced File Viewer

**Why we use it:**
- Similar to `more` but with more features (scroll back, search, jump to end).  
- More efficient for very large files.  

**Background working:**
- Unlike `cat` or `more`, `less` doesn’t load the entire file at once.  
- It reads chunks of the file into memory (lazy loading).  
- It allows backward navigation and uses `ioctl()` calls to detect terminal size and adjust output dynamically.  

---

## 🔑 Summary

- These commands are **fundamental building blocks** of Linux.  
- They work closely with the **kernel system calls** like `open()`, `read()`, `write()`, `chdir()`, `rename()`, `unlink()`.  
- Even though they look simple, they are highly optimized and deeply tied to the filesystem.  

👉 Without these, navigation and file manipulation on Linux would be impossible.
